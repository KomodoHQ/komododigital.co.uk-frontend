# Infrastructure & Deployment

We automatically deploy using Codeship to AWS Cloudfront! The process, components and configuration are explained below.

Currently, our configured sites are available at:

URL                              | Function                                 
-------------------------------- | ---------------

d3ni409s7fq6ur.cloudfront.net    | Production Site

## Infrastructure

Our site is hosted on Amazon AWS, and served by Amazon CloudFront edge nodes. To set this up we need to:

 - Create an S3 bucket to host our source
 - Create a CloudFront Distribution to serve our source
 - Create Amazon Lambda functions to mutate some of our request / responses for security reasons, and to handle cache control (see `https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/docs/caching.md` and `https://www.ximedes.com/2018-04-23/deploying-gatsby-on-s3-and-cloudfront/`).

### AWS S3 Bucket Creation / Configuration

1. Login to Amazon AWS, select your hosting region (in our case we host in `eu-west-2`, ie. London).
2. Select `S3` under the `Services -> Storage` menu and click `Create Bucket`.
3. Enter a DNS compliant bucket name, relevant to the DNS you will be assigning the content. For example `www.komododigital.co.uk`.
4. Ensure the region is correct, and click next.
5. Select the options as you would like on the next page. Our standard config is entirely default (no changes are made).
6. On the next screen, when prompted to Set permissions, leave all as default (i.e. No public access).
7. Confirm creation of the bucket.

### AWS CloudFront Distribution Creation / Configuration

1. Login to Amazon AWS, select your hosting region (in our case we host in `eu-west-2`, ie. London).
2. Select `CloudFront` under the `Services -> Networking & Content Delivery` menu and click `Create Distribution`.
3. Under the `Web` heading, click `Get Started`.
4. On the `Create Distribution` page, apply the following settings:

```
