# Komodo Digital Website

## Overview
This repo contains everything needed for our 2018 website refresh, written primarily using React and Gatsby JS.

## Quick Start

1. Install the gatsby cli:

```
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

2. Start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at `localhost:8000`:

```
gatsby develop
```

3. Edit the javascript pages in src/pages. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

4. Perform an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles:

```
gatsby build
```

5. Start a local webserver for testing:

```
gatsby serve
```

To see detailed documentation for the CLI commands, run in the terminal `gatsby --help` and for specific commands `gatsby COMMAND_NAME --help` e.g. `gatsby develop --help`.

## Docs

All project documentatino is in the `docs` folder.

## Happy Coding!
