The ASM Toolset has been developed with the aim of providing in one ‘document’ the entire Ammunition Safety Management (ASM) toolset. The manual has three objectives. Firstly, to provide a single point of reference for all ASM related content and materials. Secondly, to provide a basis for ASM training, education and operations. And lastly, to act as the configuration and quality library for all components of the ASM toolset.

Usability is understandably critical, so the app has been designed to be graphically minimal and simple with emphasis on the clear presentation of content. Developed using Cordova, the app can be easily rolled out and has the ability to exist cross-platform.

By undertaking research, developing standards and disseminating knowledge, the GICHD supports capacity development in mine-affected countries and those holding deteriorating, dangerous stocks of ammunition and explosives. As part of this support the GICHD works with national and local authorities to help them plan, coordinate, implement, monitor and evaluate mine action programmes.
