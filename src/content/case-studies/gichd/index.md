Komodo was chosen to partner with the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) in the development of a tablet version of their entire Ammunition Safety Management (ASM) Toolset.

This is a project with the very real aim of reducing worldwide civilian casualties from abandoned and unmanaged ammunition generally found in locations where the infrastructure is least equipped or able to afford to deal with it safely.
