The project was steered by persona-driven user stories as a way of describing the functionality required, as opposed to rigid specifications. Once a full backlog of user stories had been created it was possible to model the user flow through the app in detail, so that all features and functions described within the user stories were incorporated into the design and development workflow.

These detailed task flow diagrams allowed a clear understanding of how each feature was established and were then agreed across the project team. From here the design team would produce high fidelity wireframes, allowing us to understand how all of the elements within the application needed to fit together and provide a consistent user experience.

Our aim was to produce an application that transitioned effortlessly into the real world for police officers, so regular interaction with the end users was fundamental to the design process. This was facilitated through regular workshops with officers, providing the opportunity to conduct a ‘hands on’ test of the prototype and offer feedback.
