The Police E-Box application has been rolled out across the Northumbria Police force to several thousand officers whose feedback is highly positive. 

Northumbria Policeâ€™s Police E-Box project is transforming the way policing services are delivered to communities. Enabled by technology, officers and support staff have the ability to interact with the information they need in the place that they need it.
