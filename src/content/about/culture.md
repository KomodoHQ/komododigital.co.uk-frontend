## Empathy
**See other perspectives, seek to understand.**
Walking a mile in someone's shoes helps us to understand their environment, needs, wants and frustrations. It's an essential attribute when creating technological solutions to human problems.

## Fairness
**Be objective, be fair.**
We treat people how we expect to be treated. With respect, courtesy and honesty. We strive to make objective judgements free from bias or discrimination.

## Helpfulness
**Solve problems for others.**
Fundamentally we are here to do useful things for people. Things they cannot do or do not have the time, capacity or expertise to do. The projects we aspire to work on help people before profits but do a great job at both.
