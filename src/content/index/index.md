God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.

This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.
