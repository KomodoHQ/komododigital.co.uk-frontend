Police E-Box is a multi-phased project that sees the integration of mobile technology into police officers day to day workflow, streamlining access to information and reducing load on resource control and radio channels via smartphone technology.

After a competitive public tender process, Komodo were selected to work closely with Northumbria Police in the design and development of a native Windows mobile application. The app has now been deployed and successfully rolled out across the force.
