The idea for Theo came around with the idea of turning every car into a smart car. Revolutionising the black box into a desirable device thatâ€™s affordable and packs many more features. The main benefit being that safer drivers are rewarded, all drivers are treated fairly and driving will improve with Theo in the car.

With values between the idea and teams in alignment, we believed going forward that this product would bring a positive impact into the insuretech scene.
