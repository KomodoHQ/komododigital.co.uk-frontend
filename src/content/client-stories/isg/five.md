Design sprints are a core competency of Komodo's and are used to great effect, casting a fresh perspective across challenges allows us to redefine constraints and reframe objectives. 

It's usual to spend a full week in front of a whiteboard designing a product via a structured design sprint. During this, the teams come together without any preconceived ideas and produce what is almost a demonstratable product.

Komodos default working methodology is agile. For iamproperty, the main benefit of the agile process is the ability to start a backlog and not necessarily complete it. It allows the project team to go on a different tangent as new ideas are explored or new opportunities identified.

Cooney explains the value of this: "As a business that is constantly changing, talking to customers, changing requirements, communicating with suppliers, we have to effectively ‘manage change’" 

The weekly meetings with our team allowed iamproperty to swap and change requirements as customer and business demand changed in real time; our embedded agile methodology accommodates this readily.

To minimise friction, during project setup processes, we agree on a common set of tools and use iamproperty repositories that allow Ross and his team to shadow active projects as we work on them. This bespoke collaborative relationship creates perfect conditions for the creation of truly exceptional digital products.
