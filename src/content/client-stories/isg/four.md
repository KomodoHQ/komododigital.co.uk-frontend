iamproperty currently has an in-house development team comprising 15 individuals headed up by their CTO, Cooney. This team takes care of the heavy lifting of the day-to-day development and maintenance of their system. Their business growth trajectory is rapid, creating a high demand to release new product features faster than the in-house resources can sensibly deliver.

Outsourcing is the obvious solution but in reality, it's hard to find the right partners that will work in a way that dovetails with the in-house team and its workflows. A poor partnership creates drag and gets in the way of fast, frictionless delivery and ultimately, just creates extra work for the in-house team to do. 

The iamproperty team engage with Komodo to help them with these extra projects that they don't have the resources internally to deliver. Instead of creating drag we seamlessly augment the client team, working with their workflow to ensure a ‘buttery’ smooth delivery of projects.
