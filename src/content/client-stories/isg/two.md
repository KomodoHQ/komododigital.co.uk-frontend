During the startup phase, Komodo provided a complete design and development solution as iamproperty had no in-house resource to deliver the digital product.

As the organisation grew, more of the design and development was handled by a growing in-house team and Komodo took on the role of a specialist resource; accessed on demand when there was a need for specialised design and development tasks that fell outside of the internal teams remit.

It's 2009 and the global financial crash is causing shockwaves throughout every sector in every market. Real estate is hit hard with house prices tumbling and the mortgage market in freefall. It was risky to launch a new property auction business, even more so if this was an entirely new 'online' concept.

iamproperty, a bold startup play in an uncertain market, is today one of the rising stars in the property sector.
